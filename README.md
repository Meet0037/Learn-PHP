A. Introduction to PHP

1.How is PHP used in HTML?
---------------------------

PHP is often used to build dynamic web pages. A dynamic web page is one where each visitor to the website gets a customized page that can look different than how the site looks to another visitor. This is in contrast to static web pages which provide the same content to each visitor.

In order to create this dynamic behavior, PHP was designed to work closely with HTML. PHP can be used directly in-line with an HTML document. When the web site is delivered from the back-end to the front-end, the PHP content is executed and added to the HTML to form one HTML document. The start of in-line PHP is denoted with <?php and the end is denoted with ?>. 

As an example, consider the following code:

    <p>This HTML will get delivered as is</p>
    <?php echo "<p>But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML</p>";?>
    
In PHP, the echo keyword is used to output text. The text in this case is everything between the double quotes ("). An instruction written in PHP is called a statement. A semicolon (;) is required at the end of each statement in PHP.

So when the code above is executed, it outputs the text into the HTML file and the front-end will receive the following HTML document:

    <p>This HTML will get delivered as is</p>
    <p>But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML</p>

Example:
--------------

    Index.js
    
    <h1>My First PHP Site</h1>
    <p>This HTML will get delivered as is</p>
    <?php echo "<p>But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML</p>";?>
    <?php echo "<ul><li>You can use any HTML tags,</li><li>like this list.</li></ul>";?>
    <footer>
      <p>And this code is back in plain HTML</p>
    </footer>
    
    Output:
    
    /*My First PHP Site

    This HTML will get delivered as is

    But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML

        You can use any HTML tags,
        like this list.

    And this code is back in plain HTML/*

2.How is PHP Executed?
----------------------------

In the previous exercise, we explored how PHP can be sent from the back-end to the front-end where it is received as HTML to be displayed by a browser.

When writing a PHP script file, we still need to denote that we are beginning our PHP code using <?php, but the closing tag is no longer required. It is typically left out by convention.

For example, if the following code were placed in index.php:

    <?php
    echo "Hello, World!";

When the code above is run, "Hello, World!" will be output to the terminal.

Generally, PHP ignores whitespace (tabs, spaces, new lines), so this code yields the same result as the previous example:

    <?php
    echo     "Hello, World!";

You may be surprised that this code also works:

    <?php
    Echo "Hello, World!";

Unlike many other languages, PHP is not always case-sensitive, so Echo is a valid statement in PHP. However, it’s best practice to use standard casing – in this case, echo.

3.PHP Comments
-----------------------

Sometimes, we want to include text in our files that we don’t want the computer to execute or display to the end user. We can do this with comments. Comments can be used to annotate our code to make it clearer to ourselves or others. They are also useful to prevent lines of code from being executed without deleting them.

In PHP, there are two main ways to add comments to our code. The first is single line comments. These are typically used for short explanations or points of clarification. Either # or // can be used to create a single line comment. Anything on the same line after these symbols is not executed by PHP.

For example:

    // I will always remember this
    echo "Hello world"; // My first PHP statement

    or

    # I will always remember this
    echo "Hello, World!"; # My first PHP statement

The second type of comment is a multi-line comment. This is used for longer descriptions, a more detailed guide on how to properly use the section of code, or to prevent several lines of code from being executed. These comments are started with /* and ended with */.

For example:

    /* "I've never thought of PHP as more 
    than a simple tool to solve problems."
    - Rasmus Lerdorf */
    echo "Hello, World!";
